Contains a program which will (hopefully) compute all 1- and 2-electron integrals + the self energy and store them in files.

2-electron repulsion integrals ~ half of all integrals are computed -> ERI.dat
1-electron nuclear attraction integrals - symmetry fully exploited  -> NucAttraction.dat
1-electron kinetic energy integrals     - symmetry fully exploited  -> Kinetic.dat
Nuclear Self-Energy - treat same as nuclear repulsion in H2O case   -> SelfEnergy.dat
